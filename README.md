# Modelling-the-VIX

## Description:
Here is the data modelling i used in my bachelors thesis in economics at the UNiversity of Copenhagen
In this paper i generated 3 different econometric models used for modelling the VIX index.
My models made use of variables that express whether or not key economic indicators came above, at, or below expectations.
I then used these models to rebalance a MVP portfolio consisting of the S&P and VIXY ETF.
I showed how making use of my models, one could outperform a MVP in a recession-prone environment.

Minimizing Loss in Recession Prone Environments
Modeling and predicting the CBOE VIX index
using macro-news variables



# Folder and File Breakdown:

"Bloomberg Data" 
Contains data on key economic indicators ( inflation, unemployment, FEd rate).

"Grafer"
Contains the three grafs used in the project. This is the most interesting if you want to get an idea of how i present a months work of modelling.

"HAR_Portofolio.py"
Contains a script I used to simulate a monthly rebalanced portoflio used to outperform a basic minimum variance portoflio consisting of the two assets cosidered in the paper. 
The portfolio rebalancing is based on the results extracted from my econometric models.

"All Model Analysis.py"
Contains all of the data work, econometric modeling, and econometric tests.

"Plotting_Returns.py"
Contains all of the data visualisation used in the paper- the three graphs.
