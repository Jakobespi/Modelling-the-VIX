
The financial landscape over the past three years has been highly volatile. Throughout this time
investors have increasingly relied on the release of macroeconomic statistics to assess market conditions, shape their expectations, and guide their trading strategies. This heightened volatility becomes
particularly evident when examining the first quarter of 2020, where the Standard and Poor’s (S&P)
500 index experienced a significant 20% decline, followed by a 20% rebound in the subsequent quarter. The decision by the Federal Reserve to reduce the funds rate from 1.58% to 0.05% in March
2020 played a pivotal role in driving this development. Such an event underscore the crucial role of
volatility forecasting in financial models, and the influence of macroeconomic variables in these.

In this paper I attempt to model the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index
(VIX) from 2018 to 2023. To achieve this, I employ an HAR (Heterogeneous Autoregressive) model
structure that incorporates implied volatility, as opposed to realized volatility initially proposed by
Corsi (2009). The central hypothesis in this paper posits, that modelling the VIX can be improved
upon by making use of news variables that reflect macroeconomic statistics and their deviations from
expectations. My findings strongly reject this hypothesis, indicating that my HAR model’s performance is not significantly improved by incorporating these news variables. Nonetheless, I observe that my HAR model still achieves a certain acceptable level of fit, making it a viable tool for VIX prediction.

To evaluate the prediction capabilities of the basic implied volatility HAR structure, I follow the
evaluation methods employed by Campos et al. (2017). However, I deviate from their approach by
assessing the model’s ability to guide portfolio weightings, in order to improve upon a basic Minimum
Variance Portfolio (MVP) comprised of the S&P 500, and the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures
ETF (VIXY). Similar to Campos et al. (2017), I employ the model predictability evaluation methods
proposed by Granger and Pesaran (2000).

Based on the evaluation, I conclude that the HAR structure does not adequately predict the VIX.
This outcome can be attributed to the VIX’s clear signs of short-term memory during the observed
recession-prone period from 2020 to 2023. However, when applying an almost inverse decision rule
than that implied by the HAR-model, I find potential for minimizing downside risk during highly
volatile periods using a short-term memory model.
